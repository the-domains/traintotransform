If you always do what you have always done, you will
always get what you have always got - Henry Ford.

I want you to meet my inspiring client, who would like
to remain anonymous, and tell you about her progress so far on mission fat
loss.

This lovely lady approached me a few months ago
wishing to drop body fat.

She works
super busy night shifts but made the time to do something for herself.

She began her super awesome 

üòÅ

new diet and training program,
training 3 days a week with me. 

Although, I
have to say, I do get some death looks sometimes, especially on banded pendulum
squats, this lady just keeps going and works hard in every session and she sticks
to her diet - the attitude and focus you need to be successful.

You see, no one finds fat loss easy,
especially the diet, you got to sacrifice the foods you love and get over the psychological
challenges that are just not doing you any good ...but wow, don't you just burst
with joy with the rewards if you stick to it and just go for... It's hard... of
course it is, but take each day at a time, and you will amaze yourself, and
that is something quite profound and enriching I think..... You see anything is
possible but you are the only one that can make it happen and, to be honest,
it's kinda the way it should be because you then get to be proud of you and not
what someone else did for you.

With complete
determination and relentless efforts, today my amazingly awesome client is
looking and feeling like a new women....

She kinda walks in beaming when she arrives for her training sessions, a
big smile from me 

üòä

Included in
her training, are exercise which will help improve her structure imbalances and
posture - after her initial assessment with me, I identified muscle weaknesses
and overactive muscles.

For example, 

her
rhomboids and lower traps were weak and her pecs and lats

were overactive; 

her 

glutes were under active and hip
flexors were over active

. Still
ensuring fat loss was/is the priority goal, structural imbalances became the
secondary goal.

You may be able to see
the improvement in the below pictures.

Here are her
before and now pics and a few words from my lovely client.

_"I am a busy
professional who is well rewarded with plenty of holidays._

_Unfortunately, I got carried away with
binge-eating and not doing enough exercise._

_In my pursuit for a quick fix, I tried numerous diets, juicing,
occasionally gym sessions on cross trainer or treadmill and so on. You name it,
I've done it._

__

_I would loose
a couple of kilos but put it all back on again fairly quickly_

__

_After gaining
15kg in the past two years, enough was enough._

_I was determined to transform._

__

_I began my
journey to a healthy lifestyle with Sarah in January 2016\._

__

_Being a
strong but, at the same time, gentle character, she is such an inspiration to
me! Sarah follows my progress each step of the way._

_It's not just a physical side of
training._

_Sarah gives me a professional
advice on nutrition, supplements, and how to stay focused on my goal._

_She got me hooked up on weight training and
completely changed my eating habits._

_I
lost 10kg in 3 months!_

_I owe my
transformation to Sarah!_

__

_She makes
every session an enjoyable challenge by changing the routine and adding up new
elements to it._

__

_Sarah is the
reason I make time for the gym and prioritize it despite having a busy
lifestyle and being away a lot"_

__

_I feel
amazing,_

_Thank you Sarah x_
