Ditch the coffee and start your day with a Matcha Green Tea coconut milk powder latte

So many of us hit the coffee first thing in the morning, me included, but I wanted to share with you a green-tastic alternative which wont be such an adrenal killer but will still give you an awesome boost to your day or training....

Matcha green tea and coconut milk powder latte...

I never would have seen myself as being a matcha green tea drinker..... but I'm hooked.... add the coconut milk powder and it takes it to another level of awesomeness. But (there is always a but) you need to buy a top notch brand... there are many green teas out there that just simply taste shit... they are cheaper but its because they taste shit... sorry, they do, so get best quality you can afford and you wont go wrong. The same goes for the coconut milk powder.

Easy to make...

Just boil water, pour in blender jug with matcha, add a couple of teaspoons of coconut milk powder and blend.. Be careful when removing the lid - as air builds up during the blending from heat so you may get a short but hot blast upon opening... I open slowly and it's fine. I recently purchased a Breville Blend Active Pro blender specifically for green tea latte or bulletproof coffee made with grass fed butter, sad, I know, but my other blenders are a bit too powerful and sound like they are gonna blow up whilst blending ... this one is surprising a really good bit of kit for the price (Â£27.00) and the green tea latte's comes out perfect.

Have I convinced you yet??

Matcha Green tea has a pretty impressive list of health benefits. Here are a few.....

- Helps burn fat

- Contains a powerful catechin antioxidant called EGCg which is recognised in helping fight cancer.

- Is rich in fiber, chlorophyll, minerals and vitamins - Chlorophyll is said to help eliminate heavy metals and toxins from the body

- Contains an amino acid called L-theanine which counteracts the stimulating effects of caffeine, helps lower blood pressure, enhances mood, calms the mind and aids in concentration.

- Contains caffeine which boosts energy and endurance but with the added benefits of L-Theanine, you will not experience the usual effects of caffeine such as jitters, nervousness or hypertension just good smooth energy to keep you ticking over.

- May help improve cholesterol

- The list continues...You can't say all that about a cup of coffee, eh?!!

According to matchsource.com one cup of matcha tea has the equivalent nutritional and antioxidant values of 10 cups of brewed green tea.

And we wont stop there as coconut milk powder packs in a stack of benefits too.

Check out this link (http://www.enerhealthbotanicals.com/.../coconut-milk-powder.h...) to the Enerhealth about their absolutely delicious Coconut Milk powder - watch the vid too to learn the benefits... I have being using this product for ages... I could literally open the tub and eat spoonfuls of it... you can add to smoothies, sprinkle (or shovel it on) it over anything -- homemade soups, yogurts, ice cream, its just awesome... awesome and awesome...

Enjoy!
